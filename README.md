# Work Experience
**Software Engineer Trainee @ protiviti (_June 2022 - July 2023_)**
- Designed a robust machine learning model on Azure Databricks to analyze opportunities. Employed Python and the H2O library to create an accurate model that forecasts the probability of client engagement with specific opportunities. Achieved 95% accuracy rate by systematically selecting the best-performing machine learning algorithm.
-	Utilized scikit-learn to enhance the model and applied matplotlib for insightful visualizations, aiding in precise opportunity assessment and strategic decision-making. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in the initial stages of the project by performing data ingestion, efficiently extracting data from Salesforce using PySpark. Subsequently, I executed a comprehensive data integration process to harmonize diverse datasets, ensuring that the data was well-prepared and structured for subsequent modeling and analysis.
-	Engineered a tailored calendar system within Salesforce using Apex, streamlining meeting accessibility through Outlook. Categorized meetings into priority and general segments, elevating scheduling efficiency. 
-	I assisted the team by getting data from Azure Blob Storage, cleaning it, and using PySpark on Databricks. Afterward, I rewrote the CSV file back to Azure Blob Storage and aided in uploading this data to pipelines.

# Projects
## Intrusion detection system (_November 2021_) 
### Project overview: 
- IDS stands for Intrusion Detection System. It helps in monitoring network traffic and detects unwanted intrusions to secure our system from any kind of attacks or malwares. I basically used KNN datasets and NIDS as an algorithm to find the best possible way to get our results. I have used different models like Decision Tree Model, Gaussian Naïve Baye Model, K-Neighbors Classifier Model, Logistic Regression model. To build an algorithm for processing the data and network and monitor it for the detection of intrusion. In our project I found that the *KNN algorithm is fastest* and that's why we adopted it.

### Tools: 
**A. KDD’99 CUP DATASET**
- It is based on the data collected during DARPA's IDS evaluation programme in 1998.
- DARPA 98 consists of around 4 gigabytes of compressed raw tcp dump data from 7 weeks of network activity, which may be processed into approximately 5 million connection records, each with approximately 100 bytes. It provides a training dataset of roughly 4,900,000 single connection vectors, each of which has 41 characteristics and is labelled as either normal or attack, with only one attack type. Denial of service (dos), user to root (u2r), remote to local (r2l), and probing assaults are the four types of attacks that may be found in a military network.

## Searching for relevant text (_April 2022_)
# project overview:
- This project is dedicated to addressing this challenge by proposing a model that streamlines the process of discovering accurate and pertinent answers to questions. The model harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and leverages knowledge graphs to accomplish this objective efficiently.

## Balance of payment statistics Analysis (_September 2023_)
-	I spearheaded an exhaustive analysis of crucial economic indicators, such as Capital Accounts, Net Lending/Borrowing, and Balance on Goods, Services, and Income. This extensive examination involved harnessing a substantial dataset spanning every country from 2015 to 2020.
-	I effectively utilized the R programming language for data analysis and employed visualization methods such as scatter plots and logistic regression. The analysis revolved around four specific questions: examining trade balances, analyzing current accounts, investigating relationships between balance of payments indicators (e.g., trade balance, FDI) and key economic metrics (e.g., GDP growth, inflation, employment rates), and conducting cross-country comparative analyses.
