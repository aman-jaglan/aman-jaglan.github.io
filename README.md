## Work Experience
**Software Engineer Trainee @ protiviti (_June 2022 - July 2023_)**
- Designed a robust machine learning model on Azure Databricks to analyze opportunities. Employed Python and the H2O library to create an accurate model that forecasts the probability of client engagement with specific opportunities. Achieved 95% accuracy rate by systematically selecting the best-performing machine learning algorithm.
-	Utilized scikit-learn to enhance the model and applied matplotlib for insightful visualizations, aiding in precise opportunity assessment and strategic decision-making. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in the initial stages of the project by performing data ingestion, efficiently extracting data from Salesforce using PySpark. Subsequently, I executed a comprehensive data integration process to harmonize diverse datasets, ensuring that the data was well-prepared and structured for subsequent modeling and analysis.
-	Engineered a tailored calendar system within Salesforce using Apex, streamlining meeting accessibility through Outlook. Categorized meetings into priority and general segments, elevating scheduling efficiency. 
-	I assisted the team by getting data from Azure Blob Storage, cleaning it, and using PySpark on Databricks. Afterward, I rewrote the CSV file back to Azure Blob Storage and aided in uploading this data to pipelines.

## Projects
### Balance of payment statistics Analysis (_September 2023_)

-	I spearheaded an exhaustive analysis of crucial economic indicators, such as Capital Accounts, Net Lending/Borrowing, and Balance on Goods, Services, and Income. This extensive examination involved harnessing a substantial dataset spanning every country from 2015 to 2020.
-	I effectively utilized the R programming language for data analysis and employed visualization methods such as scatter plots and logistic regression. The analysis revolved around four specific questions: examining trade balances, analyzing current accounts, investigating relationships between balance of payments indicators (e.g., trade balance, FDI) and key economic metrics (e.g., GDP growth, inflation, employment rates), and conducting cross-country comparative analyses.

### Searching for relevant text (_April 2022_)

- Engineered a Visionary research paper that merged **NLP** techniques and **knowledge graphs**, achieving  a 69.93% passage retrieval accuracy on the SQUAD dataset.
- Demonstrated expertise in data collection, transformation, and query retrieval methods to enhance question-answering capabilities.
- Pioneered a streamlined framework combining NLP algorithms and knowledge graph integration, demonstrating real-world applicability through practical data manipulation.


## Intrusion detection system (_November 2021_)
-	Spearheaded the deployment of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to fortify network security against malicious activities.
-	Utilized KNN datasets and Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) algorithms for robust security.
-	Employed various models, including Decision Tree, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, K-Neighbors Classifier, and Logistic Regression, to optimize intrusion detection.
